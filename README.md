# Mango Chess ü•≠‚ôüÔ∏è

Stockfish and Bluetooth protocol on RISC-V [MangoPi](https://mangopi.org/mqpro) bare-metal (a "tiny, tiny computer").

\+ live streams moves and chess board state to gui

## Usage

- `make run`: send raw AT commands to the Bluetooth HC-05 module (this is mostly for testing).
- `make brain`: executes code on "Brain" Mango Pi, whichs talks to host running Stockfish. You must separately run `python engine.py`, (having previously installed all requirements in `requirements.txt`).
- `make hand`: executes program on "Hand" Mango Pi, which the player would secretly have in their pocket.

**Please read our code because we spent a lot of time making it well documented, specially `jnxu.c`, `jnxu.h`, `bt_ext.c`, and `bt_ext.h`!**

## Hardware
 - 2 Mango Pi
 - 2 HC-05 Bluetooth modules
 - 1 rotary encoder
 - 1 servo
 - Laptop and HDMI monitor
