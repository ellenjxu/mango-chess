# MY_MODULE_SOURCES is a list of those library modules (such as gpio.c)
# for which you intend to use your own code. The reference implementation
# from our libraries will be used for any module you do not name in this list.
# Editing this list allows you to control whether the program being
# built is using your code or the reference implementation for each module
# on a per-module basis. Great for testing!
#
# NOTE: when you name a module in this list, it must provide definitions
# for all of the symbols in the entire module. For example, if you list
# gpio.c as one of your modules, your gpio.c must define gpio_set_function,
# gpio_get_function, ... and so on for all functions declared in the gpio.h
# header file. If your module forgets to implement any of the needed
# functions, the linker will bring in gpio.o from reference libmango to
# resolve the missing definition. But you can't have both gpio modules!
# The linker will report multiple definition errors for every function
# that occurs in both your gpio.c and the reference gpio.o. No bueno!
#
# You shouldn't need to modify anything below this line.
